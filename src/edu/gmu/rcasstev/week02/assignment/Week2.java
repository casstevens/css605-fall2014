/**
 * Here is your assignment for Week 2:
 * 
 * DUE: September 8th at noon
 *
 * TASK 1: Copy Week2.java and Week2Test.java to your own package following the
 * same pattern as used above (i.e., replace rcasstev with your username).
 * 
 * TASK 2: Implement the averageElements and squareElements methods.
 *
 * TASK 3: Make several calls to these methods in the main method to make sure
 * they are calculating the results correctly and output the results to standard
 * out (i.e., System.out).
 *
 * TASK 4: Run the unit tests in Week2Test.java to ensure your methods are
 * correct.
 * 
 * TASK 5: Email your version of Week2.java to rcasstev@gmu.edu
