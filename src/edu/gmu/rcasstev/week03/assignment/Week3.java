/**
 * Here is your assignment for Week 3:
 * 
 * DUE: September 15th at noon
 *
 * TASK 1: Copy Week3.java and Week3Test.java to your own package following the
 * same pattern as used above (i.e., replace rcasstev with your username).
 * 
 * TASK 2: Implement the sumRowElements, sumColumnElements, and stringToArray
 * methods.
 *
 * TASK 3: Make several calls to these methods in the main method to make sure
 * they are calculating the results correctly and output the results to standard
 * out (i.e., System.out).
 *
 * TASK 4: Run the unit tests in Week3Test.java to ensure your methods are
 * correct.
 * 
 * TASK 5: Email your version of Week3.java to rcasstev@gmu.edu
 *
