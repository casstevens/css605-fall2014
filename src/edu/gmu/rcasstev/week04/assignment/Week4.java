/**
 * Here is your assignment for Week 4:
 * 
 * DUE: September 22th at noon
 *
 * TASK 1: Copy Week4.java and Week4Test.java to your own package following the
 * same pattern as used above (i.e., replace rcasstev with your username).
 * 
 * TASK 2: Implement the findValuesWithinRange method.
 *
 * TASK 3: Make several calls to this method in the main method to make sure
 * they are calculating the results correctly and output the results to standard
 * out (i.e., System.out).
 *
 * TASK 4: Run the unit tests in Week4Test.java to ensure your method is
 * correct.
 * 
 * TASK 5: Email your version of Week4.java to rcasstev@gmu.edu
